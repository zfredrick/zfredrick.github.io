  <td>As a Junior in highschool, my grade in math has been constistantly A's and B's for a couple years now. I enjoy writing as a form of expressing my opinion.</td>
  <td>I've been interested in joining the military for a while. The branches listed stood out to me for various reasons. The Navy and Marine Corps are both great options however, I like that the National Guard has less time obligation.</td>
