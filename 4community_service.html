 <body>As a member of society, I felt as though community service was a due. In order to benefit my community I participate in can food drives, voulenteer work at my church, and raking up my neighbors leaves. Helping your neighbors is a great way to build character and help others while doing so. I've also done things for family members such as fix my grandpa's air conditioning, cut 50 acres of grass (multiple times each summer), chop down numerous trees, and other home mantinence projects. I try my hardest to be benefitial to those around me.</body>
