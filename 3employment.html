 I've worked two jobs as of December 2018. Fields I've had previous expirience in include customer service, sales, communication, and working within a professional environment. A telemarketing company called The Pisa Group, has taught me how to communicate and inform customers of various features and benefits they might not have seen in keeping their subscription with the Newspaper. Although this seems irelevant to computer science, communication and the ability to get your point across is essential for any business. The company relied on me to follow their procedures and policys, violations of these would cause a hefty fine for them and termination of my job, (which never happened). Plus how many other 16 year olds worked a sales position? The other job I had was at Stefanina's Pizzeria. I was a food runner and part time busser. Food running taught me how to manage my time since the resturaunt was busy and wasted time would come back to haunt me, and also taught me how to calm down an unsatisfied customer. Bussing taught me how to do things efficiently and to cooperate with my coworkers to achieve a common goal. Both of these jobs were great oportunities and I'm happy to have worked for both companies. </body>
